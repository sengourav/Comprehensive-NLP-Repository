I've been having a persistent headache for the past few days, and it's been accompanied by dizziness and occasional nausea. I'm not sure what could be causing it.\\n\\nAgent 3: I understand your concern, Emma. Headaches can have various causes.

And I've been feeling more fatigued than usual.\\n\\nAgent 3: Thank you for sharing that information, Emma. Blurry vision and fatigue can also be related to your symptoms. It's important to consider all these factors for a proper assessment. Based on your symptoms, I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional.
